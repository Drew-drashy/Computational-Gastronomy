I have scrap the data from the BBC.com for the recipes and doing the post analysis on that. Scrap the data using the python script and python Library BeautifulSoaps.
Filter the data and do some preprocessing on the data.
And Apply the NER(Name Entity Recognition) to seperate the data in recipes ids and their ingredients by using the large model of scapy.
Plot the histogram bw the Recipe size and the frequency of the ingredients.
Plot cumulative distribution of recipe size.
Plot the frequency-rank distribution. Scale and label axes properly.
